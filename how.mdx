  Harbor by Structured integrates data from various revenue-focused tools like
  Salesforce and HubSpot into one accessible platform. This centralized system
  aggregates different data streams, making it easier to generate reports and
  analyze trends. It also supports automated alerts and provides strategic
  insights directly from your business data, without manual data merging or
  schema management. Users can connect their data sources simply and use AI to
  map and link these sources, building a semantic layer purpose-built for
  revenue operations.

  After Structured‚Äôs central data plane is configured, go to the Query
  interface, ask a question in natural language. Structured uses the underlying
  data model configured to give the most up-to-date answer. Our system uses AI,
  RAG, and code-generation to understand context and relationships efficiently,
  providing clean, up-to-date responses with beautifully generated charts. Use
  the guided explorer to slice and dice the data to find the answers you need.
  For example, a user might ask, "What were the total sales last quarter for
  product X in region Y?" and receive not only the figures but also comparative
  charts and trend analysis.

  Dynamic documents enable collaboration with Structured AI to build the reports
  you need for effective data storytelling. Auto-generate reports with the most
  interesting insights. Edit titles, prompts, contents, chart types to
  personalize. Start with a blank report or use our templates for common
  workflows, sharing, editing, scheduling with teammates. Refresh reports as new
  data flows in. For instance, you could automatically generate a monthly sales
  performance report that highlights top-performing regions and products, with
  the option to easily update or customize the visuals and data points as needed

  Our custom workflow builder lets you specify automations between different
  objects in disparate systems with a high degree of trust. For example, Metrics
  could help marketing and sales alignment by automatically sharing lead scoring
  updates from marketing the CRM, ensuring that sales reps focus their efforts
  on the most qualified leads. View Structured Metrics run history, track
  changes over time, identify failures, resolve issues. Share these automations
  with your team -- so you never become a single point of failure again.

Keep your revenue operations team informed with Alerts. Configure notifications for 
important revenue events, such as achieving sales targets or when subscriptions are 
about to expire. Set up alerts for significant changes in revenue streams or contract 
status updates to ensure prompt action. These real-time notifications help your team 
stay on top of critical developments, improving responsiveness and operational continuity. 
You can also track performance against forecasts and receive alerts if figures deviate from 
expected ranges, enabling quick adjustments.
