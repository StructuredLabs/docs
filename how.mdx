  Structured provides a common data model across all different revenue
  team-specific point solutions, such as Salesforce, HubSpot, etc. Structured is
  a data lake that encompasses all those streams of data, enabling analytics,
  report generation, answering questions, and identifying the most strategically
  relevant insights about business without the manual consolidation of data and
  schemas.

  providing clean, up-to-date responses with beautifully generated charts.
