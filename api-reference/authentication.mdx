API tokens are personal access credentials that you can use to authenticate with our API. These tokens provide an alternative to using personal passwords and are the recommended authentication method when interacting with the API programmatically.

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <your_personal_access_token>'
```

## API Tokens

API tokens allow you to authenticate with our API endpoints securely. Each user can generate up to three tokens, which can be used to perform actions via the API with the same permissions as your user account.

To generate a new API token, navigate to the 'API Token Management' section in your user settings. From there, you can create a new token, copy it to your clipboard, and manage existing tokens.

### Generating a New Token

To generate an API token:

1. Go to the 'Settings' page of your account.
2. Click on 'API Token Management'.
3. Press the 'Generate Token' button.
4. Copy the generated token immediately, as it will not be displayed again for security reasons.

Remember to store your token in a secure place. Treat your tokens as you would your password.

### Using Your Token

To use your token, include it in the Authorization header of your API request:

```bash
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your_personal_access_token>' https://api.ourdomain.com/v1/endpoint
```

Replace `<your_personal_access_token>` with the API token you generated.

### Revoking a Token

If you need to revoke an API token:

1. Navigate to the 'API Token Management' section in your settings.
2. Find the token you wish to revoke in the list.
3. Click the 'Revoke' button next to the token.
4. Confirm your action in the dialog that appears.

Once a token is revoked, it cannot be used for API authentication and you cannot retrieve it again.

### Permissions

The permissions associated with an API token are the same as your user account's permissions. If you have limited access to certain resources, your token will inherit those restrictions.

Ensure you follow the principle of least privilege and only generate API tokens on accounts that have the necessary permissions for the tasks you want to perform via the API.
