After you’ve connected your data sources, Structured will start its first data sync. This is where the platform scans your tables, columns, models, and other metadata. This process will take just a few minutes.

Here’s what’s happening under the hood:

- **Metadata Extraction:** Structured pulls in all the information about your tables, models, columns, and relationships from your data sources.
- **Metrics Identification:** Structured will also look for any pre-defined metrics you have, and begin setting those up for management and tracking.

After the initial sync, go to your Definitions page in the admin dashboard. You’ll now see all the tables and models Structured has pulled in from each connected source.

You can click on each table to view its structure, the columns it contains, and how it connects to other tables.

In the next section, we’ll dive deeper into how to start exploring your definitions, managing your metrics, and making the most of the semantic layer Structured has built for you.
