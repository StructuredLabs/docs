### Supported Data Platforms

Structured integrates with most modern data platforms. [Here](/integrations) are the ones we support out of the box. If your company uses one (or more) of these platforms, connecting them to Structured is simple.

In the dashboard, go to the Connections section and click on "+ New." You’ll be prompted to select from the list of supported platforms.

- **Enter Connection Details:** For each platform, you’ll need to provide specific connection information (e.g., credentials, API keys, server addresses).
- **Test the Connection:** Before finalizing, you can test the connection to make sure everything is set up correctly
- **Authorize Access:** For cloud-based platforms like BigQuery or Snowflake, you might need to authorize Structured to access your data. This process is straightforward and usually involves logging in with your credentials and granting permissions.

Once you’re connected, Structured will automatically start scanning your data sources and pulling in the metadata. This is where things get exciting.
