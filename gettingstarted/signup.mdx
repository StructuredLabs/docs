Getting started with Structured is quick and simple. Here’s how you create your account:

- **Go to the Sign-Up Page:** https://app.structuredlabs.com/sign-up
- **Enter Your Details:** Provide the necessary information like your name, email
- **Set Up Your Workspace:** After signing up, you’ll be prompted to create a workspace. A workspace is where all your data sources, models, and metrics will live, so give it a name that makes sense for your team or project.

Once your account is created and your workspace is set up, you’ll land in the Structured dashboard.

### Navigating the Dashboard

- **Connections:** A section that shows all your connected databases and platforms.
- **Definitions:** This is where you’ll find models (like "Customer" or "Order") from your data.
- **Ask AI:** Your go-to place for asking questions about your data tables in natural language.
- **Alerts:** If there are any issues, like a breaking change in a data source, you’ll see it here.
- **Tickets:** This section tracks all open and resolved tickets for data requests or changes, allowing you to manage ongoing tasks and see the status of pending actions.
