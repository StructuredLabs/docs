  version control tracks all changes, ensuring that your metrics remain accurate
  and consistent over time. This governance model helps maintain trust and
  integrity across all levels of the organization.

  Structured's AI-driven alerts notify you before these issues escalate,
  allowing for quick, informed decision-making. This proactive approach helps
  you stay ahead of potential problems and ensures smooth operational
  performance.

  data discrepancy, or additional analysis, you can easily submit, track, and
  resolve these requests within the platform. Additionally, Structured
  automatically generates documentation as you set up and manage metrics,
  providing a reliable reference point for all users.
