## Salesforce Integration

### Setting Up Salesforce Integration

1. **Find Salesforce in Integrations:** Within Structured's "Integrations" section, select Salesforce.
2. **Authenticate:** Click "Connect to Salesforce" and sign in to your Salesforce account. This process may involve OAuth authentication, seamlessly integrating without needing to manually enter API keys.
3. **Select Objects to Sync:** Choose Salesforce objects (e.g., Leads, Opportunities) for synchronization. You might also need to define the fields within each object.
4. **Sync Configuration:** Set up your sync frequency and data filtering criteria.

### Access Control

- Salesforce authentication typically requires admin permissions to grant API access.
- Determine who in Structured has access to Salesforce data, aligning with your organizational data governance policies.

5. **Configure Sync Settings:** Decide on the frequency of synchronization and any specific data filters.
