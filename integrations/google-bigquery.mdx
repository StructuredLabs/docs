## **Integrating Google BigQuery with Structured**

Google BigQuery is a powerful data warehouse that allows you to analyze large datasets quickly. Integrating BigQuery with Structured enables the creation of a robust semantic layer, ensuring consistent and accurate business metrics across your organization.

### **Step 1: Access the Integration**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations" icon="compass">

  <Step title="Grant Permissions" icon="unlock">
    Approve Structured’s access to your BigQuery data. This includes permissions
    to read and query datasets.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### **Step 3: Select BigQuery Projects and Datasets**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose BigQuery Project" icon="diagram-project">
    After authentication, select the specific BigQuery project you want to pull
    data from.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Datasets and Tables" icon="table">
    Choose the datasets and tables you wish to integrate with Structured. You
    can select multiple datasets to ensure comprehensive data coverage.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### **Step 4: Configure Data Sync**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Sync Frequency" icon="rotate">
    Set up how frequently you want Structured to sync data from BigQuery (e.g.,
    hourly, daily).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Filters" icon="filter">

  </Step>
</Steps>

### **Step 5: Leverage the Semantic Layer**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Map Data to Metrics" icon="sitemap">
    Use Structured's interface to map the data from BigQuery to your
    organization's standardized metrics. This step ensures that all data used in
    reports and dashboards are consistent across departments.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create and Standardize Metrics" icon="ruler-combined">
    Define new metrics or standardize existing ones using the integrated

## **Access Control and Permissions**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Google BigQuery Permissions" icon="shield">
    Ensure the Google account used for the integration has the necessary
    permissions to access and query the selected datasets. Typically, this
    requires at least **Viewer** access to the BigQuery project.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Structured Permissions" icon="lock">
    Within Structured, define who can view, edit, or manage the BigQuery
    integration and associated metrics. This aligns with your organization’s
    data governance policies.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## **Conclusion**

Integrating Google BigQuery with Structured allows your organization to fully leverage the power of BigQuery’s data storage and analysis capabilities while ensuring consistency and reliability through Structured’s semantic layer. This integration not only enhances operational efficiency but also supports data-driven decision-making across the organization.
