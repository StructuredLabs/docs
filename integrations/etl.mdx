## Fivetran Integration

### Setting Up Fivetran Integration

1. **Navigate to Integrations:** In Structured, access the "Integrations" section and select "Fivetran."
2. **Authenticate Your Account:** Click "Connect to Fivetran." You'll be redirected to a Fivetran login page. Authenticate by logging in to your Fivetran account.
   - You may need to enter your Fivetran API Key and API Secret, found under the Fivetran dashboard's settings or account section.
3. **Select Connectors:** After authentication, choose which Fivetran connectors (data sources) you wish to sync with Structured. Fivetran's UI will list available connectors you've set up.
4. **Configure Sync Settings:** Define the frequency of data synchronization and select specific tables or schemas you want to import.

### Access Control

- **Fivetran Permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions in Fivetran to create or manage connectors and access API keys.
- **Structured Permissions:** In Structured, determine who can view or manage the imported data from Fivetran, adhering to your data governance policies.

## Airflow Integration

Integrating Airflow with Structured involves leveraging Airflow's capabilities to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows.

### Setting Up Airflow Integration

1. **Access Airflow DAGs:** The integration primarily involves setting up Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in Airflow that interact with Structured's API.
2. **Authenticate:** Use Structured's API keys for authentication in your Airflow scripts. Securely store these keys in Airflow's connections or secrets manager.
   - Example: Utilize the `HttpHook` or similar Airflow components for API authentication.
3. **Script Your Data Pipeline:** Write Airflow scripts (DAGs) that define your ETL process. This can include extracting data from sources, transforming it as needed, and loading it into Structured.
   - Use Airflow operators to interact with Structured's API, ensuring data is pushed or pulled based on your workflow requirements.
4. **Schedule and Monitor:** With Airflow's scheduler, set how often your ETL processes run. Monitor execution and logs through Airflow's UI to ensure data flows as expected into Structured.

### Access Control

- **Airflow Permissions:** You'll need appropriate access to your Airflow instance to create and manage DAGs.
- **Structured API Access:** Manage who in your team has access to Structured's API keys, essential for scripting ETL processes in Airflow.
