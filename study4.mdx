## Background

A rapidly growing SaaS company struggled with inconsistent data definitions across different teams, leading to misunderstandings and discrepancies in reporting and analysis. This lack of standardization hindered collaboration and decision-making processes.

## Challenge

- üìä Inconsistent data definitions and terminology across departments, causing confusion and discrepancies in reports.

### Step 2: Link Definitions to Data Sources

1. **Integration with Data Sources:**
   - Link glossary terms directly to relevant data sources within Structured, ensuring that definitions are easily accessible during analysis.
2. **Automatic Updates:**
   - Enable automatic updates for glossary terms, ensuring that any changes or additions are reflected across all connected data sources in real-time.

### Step 3: Promote Adoption and Collaboration

1. **Training and Education:**
   - Conduct training sessions to educate employees on the importance of standardized data definitions and how to utilize the Structured glossary effectively.
2. **Cross-Functional Collaboration:**
