### Without Structured, this type of data analysis can require extensive manual data consolidation efforts. Revops team would need to:

- **Identify Relevant Data Sources**: Manually sift through a tangle of data sources to find necessary information.
- **Manually match schemas**: Different schemas across data tables? mapping these relationships manually is necessary, but time-consuming and slow (and prone to error)
- **Manually join table columns**: Hairy one-off SQL queries or excel copy-paste for joining data (requires in-depth understanding of all the data sources -- and sql)
- **Clean and normalize data**: The joined data often required additional cleaning to ensure consistency and accuracy before it can be used for analysis.

This manual approach is fraught with challenges:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Complexity of Join Conditions" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Errors in specifying join conditions could lead to inaccurate results, such
    as missing or incorrectly associated data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Schema Evolution" icon="rotate">
    Over time, changes in data sources could make previous join logic obsolete,
    necessitating ongoing maintenance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Quality Issues" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Source data inconsistencies or errors could compromise the joined dataset's
    accuracy.
  </Step>
</Steps>
