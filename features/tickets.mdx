Structured’s Ticketing feature is designed to streamline the management of data-related requests within your organization. Whether it’s a request for a new metric, a clarification on existing data, or a deep-dive analysis, Structured’s ticketing system ensures that every request is tracked, managed, and resolved efficiently, fostering better communication and collaboration across teams.

## **What Are Tickets in Structured?**

Tickets in Structured are formal requests that can be submitted by any team member for data-related needs. These requests could involve creating new metrics, resolving data discrepancies, or conducting specific analyses. The ticketing system integrates with Structured’s semantic layer, ensuring that all requests are managed with full visibility into the underlying data structures and definitions.

### **Key Features of the Ticketing System**

  <Accordion title="Integration with Semantic Layer" icon="layer-group">
    Each ticket is linked to the specific metrics and data definitions within
    the semantic layer. This integration ensures that any requests involving
    data or metrics are addressed with a full understanding of the context and
    the standardized definitions, reducing the risk of miscommunication or
    errors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Prioritization and Categorization" icon="filter">

    business impact. This feature allows teams to focus on the most critical
    requests first, ensuring that high-impact issues are resolved quickly.

  <Accordion title="Collaboration and Assignment" icon="gear">
    Tickets can be assigned to specific team members or departments,

## **How to Use the Ticketing System in Structured**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Submit a Ticket" icon="pencil">
    To submit a ticket, navigate to the ticketing interface and fill out the
    required details. This includes specifying the type of request, the metrics
    or data involved, and any relevant deadlines or priorities. Providing clear
    and detailed information at this stage helps ensure a faster resolution.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Assign and Prioritize" icon="user-check">
    Once a ticket is submitted, it can be assigned to the appropriate team or
    individual based on the nature of the request. Prioritization can be set to
    ensure that high-priority tickets are addressed first. The system allows for
    categorization, which helps in organizing and managing multiple tickets
    simultaneously.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Collaborate and Resolve" icon="comments">
    The assigned team members can collaborate directly within the ticket, adding
    comments, sharing files, and updating the status. This collaborative
    environment ensures that all relevant information is centralized, making it
    easier to resolve the request efficiently.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4: Track Progress" icon="chart-line">
    Monitor the progress of each ticket through the status tracking feature.
    This transparency allows both the requestor and the resolver to stay
    informed of any updates or changes. Notifications can be set up to alert
    team members of any significant progress or when the ticket is resolved.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 5: Close and Document" icon="folder-closed">
    Once the request has been resolved, the ticket can be closed. Structured
    automatically documents the resolution process, making it easy to refer back
    to previous tickets if similar issues arise in the future. This
    documentation also contributes to the knowledge base, supporting continuous
    improvement.
