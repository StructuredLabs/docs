Effective governance is critical for ensuring that your business metrics remain accurate, consistent, and trustworthy over time. Structured’s Governance Control features empower your organization to manage, track, and audit metric definitions and data transformations, providing a robust framework for maintaining data integrity.

## **What is Governance Control?**

Governance Control in Structured encompasses the processes, roles, and tools required to manage and oversee the standardization and application of business metrics. This includes version history, metric ownership, change tracking, and permissions, all of which help ensure that your metrics remain consistent and aligned with your business objectives.

## **Key Governance Features in Structured**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Version History and Control" icon="timeline">
    Structured tracks every change made to your metric definitions, storing a
    complete version history. This allows you to review, compare, and revert to
    previous versions of metrics if needed. Version control ensures that any
    changes to metrics are transparent, traceable, and easily managed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Metric Ownership" icon="user-shield">
    Assign specific teams or individuals as owners of each metric. Metric owners
    are responsible for approving changes, overseeing the accuracy of the
    metric, and ensuring it aligns with business goals. This feature helps
    maintain accountability and clarity over who controls critical business
    metrics.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Audit Trails" icon="file">
    Every action taken on a metric—whether it’s a change in definition, an
    update to data sources, or a modification of business rules—is recorded in
    an audit trail. This comprehensive log allows you to see who made changes,
    what changes were made, and when they occurred, providing full transparency
    and compliance support.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Access Control and Permissions" icon="lock">
    Structured allows you to define and manage permissions for accessing and
    modifying metric definitions. Control who can view, edit, or approve changes
    to ensure that only authorized users can make modifications. This reduces
    the risk of unauthorized changes and helps maintain data integrity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Change Management" icon="code-branch">
    When a metric definition is updated, Structured’s change management process
    ensures that all stakeholders are informed and that changes are implemented
    smoothly across the organization. Notifications can be set up to alert
    relevant teams when critical metrics are modified, ensuring that everyone is
    aligned.

## **Steps to Implement Governance Control Using Structured**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Assign Metric Ownership" icon="user-tag">
    Start by assigning ownership of each key business metric to a specific team
    or individual. Metric owners are responsible for overseeing the accuracy and
    alignment of the metric with business objectives. This ensures
    accountability and clarity over who controls critical business metrics.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Define Access Permissions" icon="key">
    Set up access controls to define who can view, edit, or approve changes to
    metric definitions. By limiting access to authorized users, you reduce the
    risk of unauthorized changes and maintain the integrity of your metrics.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Track and Manage Versions" icon="code-fork">
    Use Structured’s version control to track all changes made to metric
    definitions. This allows you to review past versions, compare changes, and
    revert to previous versions if needed. It ensures that your metrics evolve
    in a controlled and transparent manner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4: Monitor Audit Trails" icon="eye">
    Regularly review audit trails to monitor all actions taken on your metrics.
    This includes changes to definitions, data sources, and business rules.
    Audit trails provide full transparency, helping you maintain compliance and
    accountability.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 5: Manage Changes and Communicate" icon="bullhorn">
    Implement a change management process to ensure that any updates to metric
    definitions are communicated to all relevant stakeholders. Set up
    notifications to alert teams when critical metrics are modified, ensuring
    alignment across the organization.
  </Step>
