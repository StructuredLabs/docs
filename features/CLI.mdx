## Introduction

StructBlk CLI transforms the way developers interact with APIs by providing a powerful command-line interface. It simplifies tasks from API management to deployment, all via intuitive commands.

## Getting Started with StructBlk CLI

Install StructBlk globally to ensure that the CLI commands are accessible from any directory in your shell environment. This is essential for seamless interaction with the StructBlk suite across your projects.

```bash
npm install -g structblk
```

Global installation (`-g` flag) ensures that the CLI commands are available system-wide, making it convenient to execute commands from any location in your terminal.

## CLI Commands

### `set-api-key`
