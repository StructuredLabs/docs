Structured’s Semantic Layer is the core feature that ensures your business metrics are consistently defined, managed, and applied across your organization. By leveraging a semantic layer, Structured transforms how you interact with data, turning complex and disparate datasets into a unified, reliable source of truth.

## **What is a Semantic Layer?**

    The semantic layer enables you to define business metrics such as CAC, MRR,
    and Churn Rate in a consistent manner. These definitions are shared across
    all departments, ensuring that everyone in the organization works with the
    same understanding of these metrics.

    It integrates data from various sources and applies transformation rules to
    convert raw data into meaningful metrics. For example, it can aggregate data
    from marketing, finance, and product departments to compute a standardized
    CAC.

  <Card title="Governance and Control" icon="gavel" iconType="duotone">
    The semantic layer supports robust governance by tracking changes to metric
    definitions. It includes version control, allowing you to revert to previous
    versions if needed, and assigns metric ownership to specific teams or
    individuals.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistency Across Tools" icon="rotate" iconType="duotone">
    By providing a centralized definition of metrics, the semantic layer ensures
    that every tool and platform in your organization uses the same metric
    definitions, whether it’s a BI tool, CRM, or custom application.

## **How the Semantic Layer Works**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect and Centralize Data" icon="database">
    Structured connects to your cloud data warehouse and integrates with various
    data sources within your organization. The platform ingests this data into
    the semantic layer, where it is mapped according to your business rules and
    metric definitions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define and Manage Metrics" icon="gear">
    Define your key business metrics within the semantic layer by specifying how
    each metric should be calculated, which data sources to use, and what
    business rules to apply. This ensures consistent metric calculations across
    the organization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Governance and Version Control" icon="code-compare">
    Govern your metrics through robust version control, ensuring that any
    changes are tracked, with clear records of who made changes and why. This
    maintains trust and integrity in your business metrics.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Real-time Data Transformation" icon="business-time">
    The semantic layer continuously applies business rules and transformations
    as data flows into the system, updating your metrics in real-time and
    ensuring that your business decisions are based on the most current data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Consistent Metric Application" icon="xmarks-lines">
    All departments and tools in your organization use the same metrics,
    ensuring consistency in reports, dashboards, and analysis. This unified
    approach eliminates the common problem of conflicting numbers.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## **Benefits of the Semantic Layer**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Consistency Across the Organization" icon="user">
    By centralizing metric definitions, the semantic layer ensures that every
    team and tool within your organization is using the same, consistent
    metrics. This eliminates discrepancies and aligns all departments.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Improved Decision-Making" icon="chart-line">
    With reliable and consistent metrics, your executive team can make strategic
    decisions with confidence, knowing that the data they rely on is accurate
    and aligned across the entire organization.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Efficient Governance" icon="lock">
    The semantic layer provides a framework for managing and governing business
    metrics, ensuring that changes are controlled and documented. This reduces
    the risk of errors and increases trust in the data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scalability" icon="up-right-and-down-left-from-center">
    As your organization grows and your data landscape becomes more complex, the
    semantic layer scales with you, continuously managing and integrating new
    data sources and metrics without compromising consistency.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Enhanced Collaboration" icon="people-arrows">
    With all departments using the same metric definitions, collaboration is
    streamlined. Teams can focus on analyzing data and making decisions rather
    than reconciling conflicting numbers or debating definitions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## **Real-World Example**

Imagine your company’s marketing, finance, and product teams each define Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) differently. Marketing excludes overhead costs, finance includes them, and product focuses on ad spend only. The semantic layer in Structured allows you to define CAC once, integrating all relevant data sources and applying consistent business rules. Now, when the CEO asks for the CAC, all departments report the same number, ensuring aligned decision-making.

## **Conclusion**

The semantic layer is the cornerstone of Structured’s platform, transforming how organizations manage, govern, and utilize business metrics. By ensuring consistency, enhancing governance, and enabling real-time data transformation, the semantic layer empowers your organization to make data-driven decisions with confidence and clarity.
