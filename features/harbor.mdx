## Manage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="🔄 Automated Data Versioning" defaultOpen>
    Automatically monitors and logs any changes made to your data sources. It
    saves previous versions of your data before updates are applied, creating a
    detailed history of how your data has evolved over time. This is crucial for
    tracking changes, understanding trends, and ensuring you can always access
    historical data when needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="📍 Unified Data Mapping" defaultOpen>
    Simplifies the process of ensuring consistency across different data
    systems. By setting up mappings, or connections, between similar data fields
    in various systems, it ensures that information is synchronized. For
    example, customer details from your CRM system can be automatically matched
    and updated in your accounting software, keeping your records accurate and
    up-to-date across platforms.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="💡Associative Data Linking" defaultOpen>
    Easily link related data points throughout your systems, by transforming a
    basic field into a direct link to a different table's schema. Structured
    automatically connects related information to make your data more useful for
    deeper analysis. This means you can find important patterns and insights
    without having to sort and link data manually, helping you make better
    decisions and plan more effectively.
