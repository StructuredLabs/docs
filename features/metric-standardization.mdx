Metric standardization is a crucial process for ensuring that all teams within your organization are aligned on the definitions and calculations of key business metrics. Structured's Semantic Layer plays a pivotal role in this process, enabling consistent, accurate, and trustworthy metrics across your organization.

## **What is Metric Standardization?**

Metric standardization involves defining, managing, and applying consistent metrics across all departments in your organization. By ensuring that metrics like Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), and Churn Rate are calculated the same way throughout the organization, you eliminate discrepancies and foster data-driven decision-making.

## **How the Semantic Layer Supports Metric Standardization**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Centralized Metric Definitions" icon="globe">
    The Semantic Layer allows you to define and store business metrics
    centrally. These definitions serve as the single source of truth, ensuring
    that every department uses the same criteria and calculations for key
    metrics. Whether it's a simple metric like total revenue or a more complex
    one like customer lifetime value, the Semantic Layer ensures that everyone
    is on the same page.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Automated Data Transformation" icon="right-left">
    The Semantic Layer automatically transforms raw data from various sources
    according to the standardized metric definitions. For example, when
    calculating CAC, the Semantic Layer integrates data from marketing, sales,
    and finance systems, applies the defined business logic, and produces a
    consistent and accurate metric across the organization.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Version Control and Governance" icon="gavel">
    Structured’s Semantic Layer includes robust version control and governance
    features. When a metric definition is updated, the Semantic Layer ensures
    that all changes are tracked and documented. This provides transparency and
    accountability, allowing teams to trust the integrity of the metrics they
    rely on for decision-making.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consistency Across Tools" icon="rotate">
    By centralizing metric definitions, the Semantic Layer ensures that these
    metrics are consistently applied across all business tools and platforms.
    Whether you're using BI tools, CRM systems, or custom applications, the
    metrics calculated and displayed are aligned with the standardized
    definitions in the Semantic Layer.

## **Steps to Standardize Metrics Using the Semantic Layer**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Define Your Metrics" icon="pencil">
    Start by defining your key business metrics in Structured’s Semantic Layer.
    Specify the data sources, the business logic, and any specific rules that
    should be applied. For example, define Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) by
    including ad spend from marketing, sales commissions, and overhead costs
    from finance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Map Data Sources" icon="map">
    Map the relevant data sources to each metric definition within the Semantic
    Layer. Structured will pull data from these sources automatically, applying
    the predefined transformations to generate the metric. This ensures that
    every department is using the same, consistent data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Apply Governance" icon="shield">
    Assign ownership of metrics to specific departments or teams, and use
    Structured’s governance features to track changes. This step is crucial for
    maintaining the integrity of your metrics over time. With version control,
    you can easily revert to previous definitions if necessary, ensuring
    stability and trust.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4: Monitor and Adjust" icon="eye">
    Continuously monitor the performance of your standardized metrics and make
    adjustments as needed. The Semantic Layer allows for real-time updates,
    ensuring that your metrics evolve with your business needs without
    sacrificing consistency or accuracy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 5: Ensure Consistency Across Tools" icon="rotate">
    Finally, integrate the Semantic Layer across all your business tools. This
    ensures that every tool your teams use—from analytics platforms to CRM
    systems—applies the same standardized metric definitions, preventing
    discrepancies and fostering alignment across the organization.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## **Real-World Example**

<Frame caption="Example: Standardizing Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)">
  <img noZoom src="/images/cac_standardization.png" />
</Frame>

Let’s say your marketing, finance, and product teams each calculate Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) differently. The Semantic Layer in Structured allows you to define CAC once, integrating data from all relevant sources and applying consistent business rules. This ensures that when the CEO requests CAC data, all departments report the same figure, leading to aligned decision-making.

## **Conclusion**

Metric standardization, powered by Structured’s Semantic Layer, is essential for ensuring consistency, accuracy, and trust in your business data. By following the steps outlined above, your organization can eliminate discrepancies, improve decision-making, and enhance operational efficiency, all while maintaining a single source of truth for your critical business metrics.
