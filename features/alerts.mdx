Structured’s Alerts feature is designed to keep your team informed and responsive to critical changes in your business metrics. By leveraging the power of Structured’s centralized semantic layer, Alerts provide real-time notifications that help you manage key performance indicators (KPIs) and other essential metrics, ensuring that your organization can act swiftly and effectively.

## **What Are Alerts in Structured?**

Alerts in Structured are automated notifications triggered by specific changes or thresholds in your business metrics. These alerts are integrated directly with the semantic layer, ensuring that they are based on the most accurate and consistent data available across your organization.

### **Key Features of Alerts**

    in customer churn.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Customizable Conditions" icon="sliders">
    You can customize the conditions under which alerts are triggered to match
    the specific needs of your business. Whether you need to monitor sales
    targets, inventory levels, or compliance deadlines, Structured allows you to
    define the exact parameters that should trigger an alert.

## **How to Set Up Alerts in Structured**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Define Alert Criteria" icon="pencil">
    Start by defining the criteria that will trigger an alert. This could
    include thresholds such as "Notify me if monthly revenue drops below
    $100,000" or "Alert me when customer churn rate exceeds 5%." These criteria
    are based on the metrics defined in the semantic layer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Customize Notification Settings" icon="gear">
    Customize how and where alerts are delivered. Choose from various delivery
    methods, including email, SMS, or push notifications. You can also set
    different alert levels (e.g., warning, critical) based on the severity of
    the event.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Integrate with Workflow" icon="sitemap">
    Integrate alerts into your team’s workflow by assigning them to specific
    individuals or teams. Structured allows you to automate the routing of
    alerts based on the type of event, ensuring that the right people are
    notified immediately.

  <Step title="Step 4: Monitor and Adjust" icon="eye">
    Once alerts are set up, monitor their performance and adjust the criteria or
    settings as needed. Structured provides analytics on alert frequency and
    response times, helping you optimize your alerting strategy.
