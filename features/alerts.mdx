Without Structured, managing these alerts could require:

- Identifying Critical Events: Manually monitoring various systems to catch significant events.

- Configuring Alerts: Setting up complex systems independently for each platform or tool.

- Maintaining Systems: Ongoing updates and checks to ensure alerts remain relevant as business processes
  evolve. This manual approach can be cumbersome and error-prone:
