Once you’ve connected your data sources and completed the initial sync, Structured gives you a clear, organized view of your data. This is where things get powerful. Instead of scrolling through raw data tables, you now have metadata-level documentation that makes your data easy to navigate, understand, and share with others. Let’s break down what that means and how you can start exploring.
Understanding Metadata-Level Documentation
Metadata-level documentation is Structured’s way of turning technical details into human-readable information. Think about all the tables, columns, and models in your databases—without context, they’re just names and numbers. Structured adds that context, making it easier for non-technical users to understand what your data represents.
At its core, Structured documents:
Tables: Your core data entities, like "Customers" or "Orders."
Columns: The attributes of those entities (e.g., "Customer Name," "Order Date").
Relationships: How different tables link together (e.g., customers are linked to orders).
Structured also creates business objects, which are high-level representations of your data that reflect your business concepts, not just your database structure. This way, everyone across the company can use the same terminology and understand what’s going on.
How Structured Organizes and Documents Your Data
When you first sync your data, Structured automatically organizes it into a structured view. Here’s how it works:
Business Objects: Rather than just showing raw tables, Structured groups related tables and models into business objects that reflect real-world concepts. For example, it might combine a "customers" table from one source and a "clients" table from another into a single "Customer" business object.
Tables and Models: Each data source will still show its underlying tables and models, but they’ll be mapped into the business objects to make it easier for you to see the bigger picture.
Metrics: Any predefined metrics tied to these tables will also be visible, with clear documentation of how they’re calculated and how they relate to the data.
The result is a single, unified view that everyone in the company can understand and trust.
Navigating Through Table and Model Definitions
Once your data is documented, you can explore it by navigating through the table and model definitions in Structured. Here’s how to get started:
Open the Data Definitions Section: From the dashboard, click on Definitions to view the list of tables and models that have been synced.
Search or Filter: Use the search bar at the top to quickly find a specific table or model. If you’re looking for something more specific, apply filters based on data source, type, or status (e.g., active, deprecated).
View Details: Click on any table or model to see its detailed definition. This includes things like:
A description of what the table or model represents
The columns it contains and their descriptions
Relationships with other tables or models
This navigation makes it easy to drill down into your data and understand it in a way that’s much more accessible than raw schemas.

Exploring Definitions in the UI
Once you’ve got your data organized into clear definitions, you’ll spend most of your time interacting with these definitions in the Structured UI. Here’s a guide to help you explore efficiently:
Filtering, Searching, and Browsing Table Definitions
Filtering: You can filter definitions by specific data sources (e.g., just Postgres tables or Snowflake models), or by types of data (e.g., financial data, user data).
Search: The search functionality in Structured is powerful. You can search by table name, column name, or even by the business object description.
Browsing: Sometimes, you might just want to browse through your data to get a feel for it. The browsing feature lets you scan through tables and models, providing a high-level overview of how your data is structured.
Viewing Data Lineage and Relationships Between Tables
Understanding how tables and data relate to one another is key, especially when you’re working with complex datasets from multiple sources. Structured provides data lineage views, which show how data flows from one table to another.
For example, if you have a "Sales" table that’s linked to a "Customer" table, you can visually see that relationship and how changes in one dataset might affect another. This helps with tracking dependencies and understanding the bigger picture of how your data fits together.

Syncing Definitions with External Tools
Structured doesn’t just keep your data documented within the platform—it makes it easy to share and sync that documentation with the tools your team already uses.
How to Sync Data Definitions with Notion
If your team uses Notion to manage knowledge or documentation, syncing your Structured data definitions is simple:
Enable the Notion Integration: In your Structured workspace, go to the Integrations section and connect your Notion account.
Choose Definitions to Sync: Select the specific data definitions you want to sync with Notion—this could be entire business objects or specific tables and models.
Sync: Once synced, these definitions will automatically appear in Notion, updated with the latest documentation. This way, your team can access data definitions directly from your Notion workspace without jumping back and forth between tools.
Scheduling Markdown Exports
If you prefer to keep your documentation in markdown format, Structured allows you to export your definitions in markdown and even set up scheduled exports. This is useful for teams that need offline access or want to version-control their documentation.
Here’s how you set up markdown exports:
Select Definitions: Choose the data definitions (tables, models, or business objects) you want to export.
Set Up Export Schedule: Choose how frequently you want the exports to occur (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly).
Receive Export: Structured will send you the markdown files via email or directly into your version control system (like GitHub), depending on your preferences.
Integrating Structured with Your Knowledge Base
Beyond Notion, Structured can sync your data definitions with other tools your team uses for knowledge management or documentation. Whether it’s Confluence, a homegrown wiki, or a different tool, Structured’s API or webhook system allows you to integrate your definitions into your existing processes.
Summary
Structured’s data definitions feature makes your data easy to understand and accessible to everyone. From metadata-level documentation that explains your tables and models in plain language to business objects that organize everything into familiar concepts, Structured transforms your data into something people can actually use.
Through the UI, you can filter, search, and explore these definitions, and with integrations like Notion and markdown exports, you can sync this knowledge with the rest of your team’s tools. Now that you know how to explore and understand your data in Structured, you’re ready to dig deeper into defining metrics and automating workflows with Structured.
