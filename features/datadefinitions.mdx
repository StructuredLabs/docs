Instead of scrolling through raw data tables, you now have metadata-level documentation that makes your data easy to navigate, understand, and share with others.

Think about all the tables, columns, and models in your databases‚Äîwithout context, they‚Äôre just names and numbers. Structured adds that context, making it easier for non-technical users to understand what your data represents.

| **Entity**    | **Description**                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tables        | Your core data entities, like "Customers" or "Orders."                                                                                                |
| Columns       | The attributes of those entities (e.g., "Customer Name," "Order Date").                                                                               |
| Relationships | How different tables link together (e.g., customers are linked to orders).                                                                            |
| Models        | Rather than just showing raw tables, Structured groups related tables into business objects that reflect real-world concepts.                         |
| Metrics       | Any predefined metrics tied to these tables will also be visible, with clear documentation of how they‚Äôre calculated and how they relate to the data. |

# Navigating Through Table and Model Definitions

Once your data is documented, you can explore it by navigating through the table and model definitions in Structured:

- üìë **Navigate to Definitions:** From the dashboard, click on Definitions to view the list of tables and models that have been synced.
- üîç **Search or Filter:** Use the search bar at the top to quickly find a specific table or model. If you‚Äôre looking for something more specific, apply filters based on data source, type, or status (e.g., active, deprecated).
- üóÇÔ∏è **View Details:** Click on any table or model to see its detailed definition. This includes things like:
  - A description of what the table or model represents
  - The columns it contains and their descriptions
  - Relationships with other tables or models

## Exploring Definitions in the UI

Once you‚Äôve got your data organized into clear definitions, you‚Äôll spend most of your time interacting with these definitions in the Structured UI.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Filtering" icon="filter" defaultOpen>
    You can filter definitions by specific data sources (e.g., just Postgres tables or Snowflake models), or by types of data (e.g., financial data, user data).
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Search" icon="magnifying-glass" defaultOpen>
  The search functionality in Structured is powerful. You can search by table
  name, column name, or even by the business object description.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Browsing" icon="eye" defaultOpen>
    Sometimes, you might just want to browse through your data to get a feel for it. The browsing feature lets you scan through tables and models, providing a high-level overview of how your data is structured.

## Syncing Definitions with External Tools

Structured makes it easy to share and sync that documentation with the tools your team already uses. If your team uses Notion to manage knowledge or documentation, syncing your Structured data definitions is simple:

- **Enable the Notion Integration:** In your Structured workspace, go to the Integrations section and connect your Notion account.
- **Choose Definitions to Sync:** Select the specific data definitions you want to sync with Notion‚Äîthis could be entire business objects or specific tables and models.
- **Sync:** Once synced, these definitions will automatically appear in Notion, updated with the latest documentation. This way, your team can access data definitions directly from your Notion workspace without jumping back and forth between tools.

## Scheduling Markdown Exports

If you prefer to keep your documentation in markdown format, Structured allows you to export your definitions in markdown and even set up scheduled exports. This is useful for teams that need offline access or want to version-control their documentation.

Here‚Äôs how you set up markdown exports:

- **Select Definitions:** Choose the data definitions (tables, models, or business objects) you want to export.
- **Set Up Export Schedule:** Choose how frequently you want the exports to occur (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly).
- **Receive Export:** Structured will send you the markdown files via email or directly into your version control system (like GitHub), depending on your preferences.

## Integrating Structured with Your Knowledge Base

Beyond Notion, Structured can sync your data definitions with other tools your team uses for knowledge management or documentation. Whether it‚Äôs Confluence, a homegrown wiki, or a different tool, Structured‚Äôs API or webhook system allows you to integrate your definitions into your existing processes.

# Summary

Structured‚Äôs data definitions feature makes your data easy to understand and accessible to everyone. From metadata-level documentation that explains your tables and models in plain language to business objects that organize everything into familiar concepts, Structured transforms your data into something people can actually use.

Through the UI, you can filter, search, and explore these definitions, and with integrations like Notion and markdown exports, you can sync this knowledge with the rest of your team‚Äôs tools. Now that you know how to explore and understand your data in Structured, you‚Äôre ready to dig deeper into defining metrics and automating workflows with Structured.
