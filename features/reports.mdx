    With a simple click on the "Iâ€™m feeling lucky" button, you can instantly
    generate a report filled with questions and prompts generated by Structured
    AI, highlighting trends, patterns, and anomalies within your data. For those
    seeking a more hands-on approach, you can manually select the data and
    prompts you want to include. This hybrid AI+human approach allows for
    customized exploration and analysis, ensuring your report focuses on the
    information most critical to your objectives. It also provides a solid
    baseline to start from.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit Components" icon="scissors" iconType="solid">
    Transform your report into a compelling narrative by customizing every
    component. Edit titles and tweak prompts to guide the AI, refine contents to
    emphasize key findings, and choose from a variety of chart types to visually
    represent your data. This step is crucial for tailoring your report to speak
    directly to your audience, making complex data accessible and engaging.{" "}

    Dive deeper into your data by adding new analyses or refining the insights
    generated by Structured AI. Drill down into specific areas of interest,
    uncover more nuanced insights and add layers of depth to your report.
    Whether you're validating hypotheses, exploring correlations, or
    investigating trends, enhancing your report with detailed analysis ensures a
    thorough and insightful examination of your data.

  <Step title="Invite Teammates" icon="users" iconType="solid">
    Invite your team to join the creation process, enriching your report with
    diverse perspectives and expertise. Collaboration is key to uncovering all
    facets of your data, so we enable team members to easily contribute to
    reports with our prompt suggestions. This not only improves the quality of
    your report but also fosters a sense of ownership and alignment among all
    the stakeholders.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Schedule Updates" icon="calendar" iconType="solid">
    Keep your report fresh and relevant by setting up scheduled updates. As new
    data becomes available, your report will automatically refresh, ensuring
    that your insights remain accurate and timely. This proactive approach saves
    valuable time and effort in manual updates, allowing you to focus on
    analysis and decision-making based on the latest information.{" "}
