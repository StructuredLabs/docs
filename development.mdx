<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You should have installed Node.js (version 18.10.0 or
  higher).
</Info>

## Step 1. Install Structured on your OS:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g structured
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add structured
```

</CodeGroup>

## Step 2. Initialize your API project:

Navigate to the directory where your autoapi.json configuration file is located and run the following command:

```bash
structured dev
```

This will bootstrap a local server for your API project, making it accessible at http://localhost:3000.

### Custom Ports

Structured uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Structured runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash
structured dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Structured in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Structured Versions

To ensure compatibility, each version of the Structured CLI is tied to a release of the Structured service. Please update the CLI regularly to match the production environment:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g structured@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade structured
```

</CodeGroup>

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Gain access to unlimited API deployments with the [Pro
  Plan](https://app.structuredlabs.io/settings/userBilling/billing)
</Tip>

You should see the following if the deploy successfully went through:
