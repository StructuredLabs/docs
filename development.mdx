## Step 1. Install Structured on your OS:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install -g structblk
```

</CodeGroup>

## Step 2. Initialize your API Key:

Navigate to the Structured Dashboard > Settings > API Token. Generate an API token, as outlined in the [Authentication](https://docs.structuredlabs.io/api-reference/authentication) page and run the following command:

```bash
structblk set-api-key <your_personal_access_token>
```

### Common Errors

You will see an error like this if you try to run Structured without running `set-api-key`.

```md
{"message":"Invalid API key","status":"error"}
```

## Structured Versions

To ensure compatibility, each version of the Structured CLI is tied to a release of the Structured service. Please update the CLI regularly to match the production environment:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g structblk@latest
```

</CodeGroup>

## CLI Commands

- ### `set-api-key`

  - **Description**: Sets or updates the Structured API Token. Prompts for the API token and saves it globally.

- ### `block-build`

  - **Description**: Builds a new block. Requests block name and description, then creates the block via the backend service using the API token.

- ### `block-deploy`

  - **Description**: Deploys the last built block. Shows a list of undeployed blocks for the user to choose and deploy using the API token.

- ### `list-all`

  - **Description**: Lists all blocks linked to the user's account. Requires the Structured API Token for accessing block information.

- ### `block-delete`

  - **Description**: Deletes a selected block. Fetches blocks from the backend for the user to choose and delete. Requires the Structured API Token.

- ### `block-update`

  - **Description**: Updates an existing block. Allows selecting and modifying a block's details like name, description, and deployment status. Needs the Structured API Token.
