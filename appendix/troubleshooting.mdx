In this section, we’ll go over common problems you might encounter in Structured and how to solve them. From connection issues with data sources to ensuring Ask AI returns accurate results, this guide will help you quickly troubleshoot and resolve issues.

## Common Issues and How to Solve Them

### Connection Issues with Data Sources

Connecting to data sources is usually seamless, but there are times when things don’t go as planned. If you’re having trouble connecting Structured to a data source (e.g., BigQuery, Postgres, Snowflake), here’s what to check:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Incorrect Credentials">
    **Solution:** Double-check that the API keys, connection strings, and
    credentials you’ve provided are accurate. Common errors include mistyped
    usernames, passwords, or wrong database URLs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Firewall or Network Restrictions">
    **Solution:** If your data source is behind a firewall or VPN, ensure
    Structured’s IP addresses are whitelisted. Contact your IT or DevOps team to
    verify this.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Missing Permissions">
    **Solution:** Ensure the user account or API key you’re using has the
    necessary permissions to access the data source (e.g., read access to
    specific schemas or tables).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Source Outages">
    **Solution:** Check the status of the data source to ensure it’s online.
    Services like Snowflake or BigQuery may experience downtime, causing
    connection failures.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  If the issue persists after trying these solutions, check the error logs in
  Structured for detailed error messages or contact Structured support for
  additional help.

### Syncing Errors and How to Resolve Them

Sometimes, data source syncing may fail or incomplete data might be synced. Here are common causes and how to fix them:

- **Partial Syncs:**

  - **Cause:** This might occur if there are large tables or data sources with high query costs.
  - **Solution:** Review the sync logs in the dashboard for throttling limits from your data provider. Adjust the sync frequency or query limits as needed.

- **Stale Data:**

  - **Cause:** Data hasn’t been updated as expected after a sync.
  - **Solution:** Manually trigger a sync from the dashboard. If the problem continues, confirm that the data source is providing fresh data and no caching settings are affecting updates.

- **Missing Tables or Columns:**
  - **Cause:** Newly added tables or columns might not sync correctly.
  - **Solution:** Ensure the sync settings in Structured include all relevant tables or models. If the missing tables are in a new schema, ensure that schema is included in the sync configuration.

### Ask AI Not Returning Accurate Results?

Ask AI is powerful for exploring your data, but occasionally, it may not return the precise results you’re looking for. Here’s how to troubleshoot and fine-tune your queries for better results.

#### How to Fine-Tune Questions for Better Results

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use Clear and Specific Language">
    **Issue:** If Ask AI returns incomplete or irrelevant results, the problem
    might be due to vague or ambiguous phrasing. **Solution:** Be specific in
    your questions. Instead of asking "What are the customer metrics?", try
    "Show me the customer churn rate for Q1."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check for Synced Data Definitions">
    **Issue:** If Ask AI can’t find certain tables or business objects, they may
    not be synced yet. **Solution:** Verify that the relevant data definitions
    are available in Structured by checking the **Data Definitions** section.
    Trigger a new sync if necessary.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask for Metadata Insights">
    **Issue:** Ask AI struggles with data requests outside its strength
    (metadata-level questions). **Solution:** Instead of asking for raw data,
    ask for metadata-related insights. For example, "What columns are in the
    Orders table?" or "How is the Customer object defined?"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Break Down Complex Questions">
    **Issue:** Complex, multi-part questions may confuse Ask AI. **Solution:**
    Simplify your queries. For example, instead of asking "What is the churn
    rate for customers in the US in Q2 and how does it compare to Q1?" break it
    down into two questions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  By refining your questions, you can help Ask AI better understand your intent
  and return more accurate results.

## Alerts and Notifications

Structured has a robust alerting system that notifies you of critical changes or issues in your data environment. Here’s how to manage alerts and what to do when you receive one.

### What to Do If You Receive a Breaking Change Alert

A breaking change alert indicates that something critical has changed in your data environment—typically a change that might affect downstream processes or reporting.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify the Issue">
    **Solution:** Go to the **Alerts** section in your Structured dashboard to
    see details about the breaking change, such as a missing column or table
    deletion.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Impact on Business Objects and Metrics">
    **Solution:** Once you identify the issue, check the related business
    objects or metrics in Structured. Structured will highlight which objects or
    metrics are affected by the breaking change.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resolve the Change">
    **Solution:** If the change was unintended, resolve the issue by restoring
    the correct data structure. If intentional, update related business objects
    or metrics to reflect the new structure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trigger Resync">
    **Solution:** After resolving the breaking change, trigger a resync to
    ensure that all data sources and definitions are updated across Structured.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### How to Manage Alert Settings

Structured allows you to customize alert settings so you only receive notifications that matter most to your team.

- **Open Alert Settings:** Navigate to the **Alerts** page in your Structured dashboard to view and customize existing alerts.
- **Customize Alert Types:** Choose from the following:
  - **Data Source Alerts:** Get notified if a data source connection fails or if there’s an issue syncing data.
  - **Schema Changes:** Receive alerts when tables, columns, or models are modified, added, or deleted.
  - **Metric Anomalies:** Set up alerts when key metrics fall outside expected ranges.
- **Choose Notification Channels:** Select whether to receive alerts via Slack, email, or directly within the Structured dashboard.
- **Set Thresholds and Frequency:** For alerts like metric anomalies, you can set thresholds (e.g., receive an alert if Customer Churn increases by more than 5% in a period). Control the frequency—whether immediately or as a daily summary.

  By managing alert settings, your team stays informed of critical changes
  without being overwhelmed by unnecessary notifications.
