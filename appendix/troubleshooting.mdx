## ▪️ Authentication with GitHub

<Steps>
  <Step title="Failed to Authenticate with GitHub">
    **Solution:** Grant the necessary permissions for Preswald to access your
    GitHub account. - Go to **GitHub Settings** → **Applications** →
    **Authorized OAuth Apps** and confirm that Preswald has the required
    repository permissions. - If authentication still fails, try logging out of
    Preswald and logging back in.
  </Step>
  <Step title="GitHub Account Not Found">
    **Solution:** Verify that you’re using the correct GitHub account. Verify
    that the account has access to the repository you’re trying to import.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>If the issue persists, contact Preswald support for assistance.</Check>

## ▪️ Importing a Repository with a Config File

<Steps>
  <Step title="Repository Not Found">
    **Solution:** Verify the repository is public or that your GitHub account
    has access to it. For private repos, confirm that you’ve granted the
    required permissions during GitHub authentication.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Config File Not Detected">
    **Solution:** Verify that your repository contains a valid `config.toml`
    file in the root directory. Check for typos or misplacement of the file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import Fails with an Error">
    **Solution:** Review the error logs in the Preswald dashboard for details.
    Common issues include missing dependencies or unsupported configurations.
    Update the `config.toml` file as needed and re-import the repository.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## ▪️ Creating an App

<Steps>
  <Step title="App Fails to Initialize">
    **Solution:** Check the `config.toml` file for missing or invalid fields,
    such as `title`, `port`, or `data connections`. Update the `config.toml` to
    be valid.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Error in App Code">
    **Solution:** Run a local version of your app using `preswald run` before
    deploying it in the cloud. Fix any errors or syntax issues in your codebase.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  For more detailed debugging, view your app’s logs in the Preswald dashboard.
</Check>

## ▪️ Deploying an Endpoint

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deployment Fails">
    **Solution:** Confirm that your `secrets.toml` file contains valid cloud
    credentials for your hosting platform (e.g., Google Cloud, AWS). Check for
    typos or missing fields.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Endpoint Not Accessible">
    **Solution:** Verify that the deployment URL is correct and that your app is
    running. Check for firewall or network restrictions that might block traffic
    to your endpoint.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  Use the deployment logs in the dashboard to identify specific issues during
  deployment.
</Check>

## ▪️ Setting Up Authentication for an App

<Steps>
  <Step title="Auth Configuration Errors">
    **Solution:** Verify the `auth` section in your `config.toml` file.
    Correctly set up authentication providers (e.g., GitHub) and provide valid
    client IDs and secrets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Users Unable to Log In">
    **Solution:** Check the authentication provider’s settings. Correctly
    configure app’s redirect URI. For example, make sure it matches the Preswald
    app’s domain and endpoint.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  Test your authentication setup using multiple accounts to make sure everything
  works as expected.
</Check>

## ▪️ Sharing a Workspace with Teammates

<Steps>
  <Step title="Unable to Share Workspace">
    **Solution:** Only organization admins can invite collaborators. If you’re
    not the workspace owner, contact the owner to manage sharing settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Invitation Not Received">
    **Solution:** Verify the email address or GitHub account of the teammate
    you’re inviting. Ask them to check their spam folder or notification
    settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collaborators Can’t Access Resources">
    **Solution:** Check that the invited teammates have the correct roles and
    permissions. Use the Preswald dashboard to update roles if necessary.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  Use the **Workspace Settings** page to review sharing configurations and
  permissions.
</Check>
